	<h1>Coastal Vulnerability Index</h1>

	<p>During my final term of college, I took a class titled "GIS and Spatial Data Science." This class taught me different methods for spatial analyses.</p>
	<p>The final for this class was very broad; think of a spatial problem and figure out a way to analyze it. I knew that I wanted to do something with the coastline and climate
	 change, but I didn't know what. Eventually I stumbled into USGS publications of this thing called "Coastal Vulnerability Index" or CVI. It was created as a way to measure the
	 vulnerability of a coastline to sea level rise. I thought that this would be a great analysis to do for my final project, so I followed the methodology (and adapted a little
	 along the way) to create a CVI for the northern Oregon coastline.</p>
	<p>The map to the right depicts the final product of my analysis. Each section of the coastline is ranked based on its vulnerability to sea level rise. My full paper is
	available for viewing below.</p>
